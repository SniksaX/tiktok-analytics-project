Privacy Policy for Personal TikTok Analytics Project
This document governs the privacy policy of the personal software application developed by me ("the developer").
Data Collection and Usage
The application uses the official TikTok API to access my own personal TikTok account data. The sole purpose of this data access is for personal analysis, data visualization, and to track content performance on a private, local dashboard.
Data Sharing and Storage
All data retrieved from the TikTok API is stored locally on my personal computer. No data will ever be shared with third parties, sold, made public, or used for any commercial purpose.
As I am the sole developer and user of this application, all data is handled directly and exclusively by me.
