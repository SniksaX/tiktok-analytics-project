# Personal TikTok Data Analytics Project

## 1. Project Overview

This is a **strictly personal, non-commercial project** developed by Siraj RG. The purpose of this application is to programmatically access my own TikTok account data for private analysis and visualization.

This repository serves as the official project documentation for my TikTok API application review.

## 2. Purpose and Goals

As a content creator, I want to gain deeper insights into my channel's performance beyond what is available in the standard in-app analytics. My goals are to:

*   **Download My Data:** Use the TikTok API to securely access my own video and profile metrics.
*   **Analyze Performance:** Analyze statistics such as views, likes, comments, shares, and follower growth over time.
*   **Create Visualizations:** Build a private, local dashboard with graphs and charts to visualize content trends and calculate engagement ratios.
*   **Personal Insight:** The entire project is for **personal educational purposes only** to improve my content strategy.

## 3. Technical Implementation

*   **Platform:** This application is a **local script** (nodejs, python, typescript) that will run on my personal desktop computer.
*   **No Public App:** There is no public-facing website or downloadable application for other users. It is a tool for my use only.
*   **API Usage:** I intend to use the **Data Portability API** or **Display API** to retrieve data related exclusively to my own user account.
*   **Data Handling:** All data retrieved from the TikTok API will be stored securely on my local machine. **The data will not be shared, sold, distributed, or displayed publicly in any way.**

## 4. Legal & Compliance

This project is designed to be fully compliant with the TikTok Developer Terms of Service and policies.
